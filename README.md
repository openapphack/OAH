# OpenAppHack(OAH)

Vendor Neutral , Opensource Apps !! 
This is where Provisioning blends with Authoring!! Your shellscript meet javascript!!

**OpenAppHack (OAH)** is built on top of opensource DevOps tools.

OAH is a vendor neutral environment provisioning approach that enables rapid development and prototyping of open source solution.

OAH encourages experimenting freely with open source application on frugal open hardware like Raspberry pi cluster and also helps easy migration of cloud deployments back to frugal physical hardware where it is feasible.
