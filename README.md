# OpenAppHack(OAH)
An Opensource App Aggregator !!
This is where your shellscript meets javascript, Provisioning blends with Authoring!!

**OpenAppHack (OAH)** is built on top of opensource DevOps tools

OAH is a vendor neutral environment provisioning approach that enables rapid development and prototyping of open source solution.

OAH encourages experimenting freely with open source application on frugal open hardware like Raspberry pi cluster and also helps easy migration of cloud deployments back to frugal physical hardware where it is feasible.
