# Overview of the Project

**OpenAppHack (OAH)** is built on top of opensource DevOps tools

OAH is a vendor neutral environment provision approach that enables rapid development and prototyping of open source solution.

OAH encourages experimenting freely with open source application on frugal open hardware like Raspberry pi cluster and also helps easy migration of cloud deployments back to frugal physical hardware where it is feasible.

# Summary of Key Features

OAH automates the provisioning of opensource virtual Environments (VEs) .

**Environment Provisioning**: Using vagrant /virtual box/docker/runc as the virtualization/containerization software or directly on to an RPI (Raspberry pi)  cluster.

**Management of Environment** : Enable self update ,upgrade, application configuration changes and user access modification for various environments through shell access or an OAH Launcher Application.

**Extend and Crowd-source, Customize Environments** : Quickly setup the necessary tools and software required to get started on opensource technologies & Frameworks.
